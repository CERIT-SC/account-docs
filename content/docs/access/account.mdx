<Callout type="info" title="Service-specific access conditions">
Aside from the general access conditions mentioned above, individual e-INFRA CZ sub-services may have additional specific conditions. Please check these at the service registration pages.
</Callout>

## How to Apply for the First Time

Your e-INFRA CZ Account is typically created automatically when you register for your first service provided by e-INFRA CZ operators. You can create your account in advance, but you'll still need to register for access to specific services.

* [Registration to e-INFRA CZ](https://signup.e-infra.cz/anyfed/registrar/?vo=e-infra.cz) to access OwnCloud or webconference, for example.  
* [Registration to MetaCenter](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/cs/application/index.html) to access Grid, Cloud and Kubernetes services.
* [Registration to IT4I](https://docs.it4i.cz/general/access/account-introduction/) to access Supercomputer.
* [Registration to SensitiveCloud](https://www.cerit-sc.cz/infrastructure-services/sensitivecloud).


During registration, **authentication via your home organization account** (e.g., university credentials) is required. Later, you can continue to access e-INFRA CZ services using these same credentials.

Later, you can access your account and services in the same way.

<Callout type="info" title="Access using additional accounts">
You may add credentials from other organizations you're affiliated with, including social providers like Google, ORCID, or Czech MojeID, to access your e-INFRA CZ Account.
</Callout>

## Compliance With Access Conditions¶

Your affiliation with an academic organization (and thus your compliance with access conditions) is usually verified automatically during service registration or upon access. 

Periodic renewal of account compliance may be required.

If compliance cannot be automatically verified due to the home organization's limitations in providing data, service operators may request additional steps individually.



## Users' Duties

## Login Process¶

 *   Log in with your home organization account
 *   Log in with your e-INFRA CZ login and password

### Log in with Home Organization Account

Typical login steps are:

1. Attempt to access the desired service.
2. Prompted to log in.
3. Select your home organization from the list of organizations.
4. Redirected to your home organization's login form.
5. Enter home organization's credentials (your home login and password).
6. Upon successful login, you are redirected back to the initially requested service.

<Callout type="info">
Alternatively, You can choose the "e-INFRA CZ password" option from the list of organizations and log in via your login and password, if available.
When logging in with e-INFRA CZ credentials, affiliation with your home organization can't be verified; as such, compliance cannot be confirmed. So, you'll need to use the home organization login method periodically to renew your account.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Limitation of available options">
Each individual service may limit available identity providers (organizations, credential types). Some options may not always be available, depending on specific service rules.
</Callout>


<Callout type="info" title="Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)"> 
**Security tip:** Enhance your account security by activating MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication). This adds verification through a registered MFA token during the login process.

</Callout>


### Login with e-INFRA CZ Password

- Certain services require an explicit e-INFRA CZ username and password.
- The credentials are defined upon the first service requiring them and shared across required services.
- These credentials can be managed via your [e-INFRA CZ User Profile](https://profile.e-infra.cz).


### Non-Web Services¶

Non-web services typically authenticate via login/password, Kerberos, or SSH keys. Refer to the respective service documentation for precise instructions.


## e-INFRA CZ Login/Password Management

By default, your e-INFRA CZ Account doesn't require new credentials; however, some services necessitate specific e-INFRA CZ username/password credentials. You will create these upon first using such a service. Once defined, these credentials are uniform across all services requiring them and managed at the [e-INFRA CZ User Profile](https://profile.e-infra.cz).


## Personal Account and Password Changes

Your account and access to services are managed by e-INFRA CZ AAI (Perun system), based on the AARC Blueprint Architecture. Account properties, settings, and passwords are conveniently managed through the [e-INFRA CZ User Profile](https://profile.e-infra.cz). Services may also have their own dedicated account settings based on their unique requirements.
