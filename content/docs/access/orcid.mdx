title: Linking an ORCID iD to Your e-INFRA CZ Account
---


This guide explains how to link your ORCID iD (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) to your e-INFRA CZ identity using the Perun profile management system.


ORCID iD is a free, globally recognized identifier that distinguishes you from other researchers with similar names (e.g., "J. Novák"). By linking it to e-INFRA CZ, you ensure:

* Your research record remains consistent even if you change institutions, email addresses, or name formats.
* It connects your publications, datasets, software, etc. across systems (Scopus, Web of Science, etc.).
* It enables e-INFRA CZ to correctly associate your publications with your user account for reporting and grant tracking.





## How to link your existing ORCID iD


If you already have an ORCID iD, follow these steps to connect it to your e-INFRA CZ account.

* Go to the e-INFRA CZ profile management page: https://profile.e-infra.cz/profile/orcid

* If you are not already logged in, you will be redirected to the e-INFRA CZ login page.
  * Select your home organization (the institution linked to your e-INFRA account) from the list.
  * Enter your standard institutional credentials.

* Once logged in, look for the ORCID section and click the 'Add your ORCID account' button.


* Authorize e-INFRA CZ 
  * Log in to your ORCID account 
  * Click Authorize access to allow e-INFRA CZ (Perun) to read your ORCID record.


* Confirmation: You will be redirected back to your e-INFRA CZ profile. You should now see your ORCID iD listed with a status confirming the link is active.






## Don't have an ORCID iD yet?

If you do not have an identifier yet, creating one takes only a few minutes.

* **Register**: Go to https://orcid.org/register.

* Enter your name and email.

* We recommend setting your profile visibility to **Public** or **Trusted Parties** so that connected systems can verify your data.

* (Recommended) Add your current affiliation and link trusted sources (e.g., Crossref) to import your outputs automatically.

## Managing your identity

Whenever you acquire a new digital identity, change your home organization, update your email address, or change your password, you can manage these settings centrally at the [e-INFRA CZ User Profile](https://profile.e-infra.cz/profile/).

## The goal: automation and accuracy 

Our overarching goal is to achieve a fully automated pipeline for capturing research impact. This ORCID-driven process will eliminate manual reporting and ensure the accuracy of data. 

To protect users from excessive reporting, we utilise an automated data collection system. For this system to function reliably, we require the users: 

 * Add [Acknowledgement of e-INFRA CZ in all publications](account#mandatory-acknowledgment-text-in-publications) 

 * **Link the ORCID iD to your e-INFRA account** and use the ORCID iD for all publications


Here is what happens in real life—and where credit often gets lost: 

| Scenario                               | Status        | The Result                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Acknowledged + ORCID registered        | ✅ Perfect    | We can connect the publication with our users automatically. Impact is fully counted. |
| Acknowledged, ORCID not registered     | ⚠️ Incomplete | We might find the paper, but we cannot reliably identify in our system who did the work. |
| ORCID registered, not acknowledged     | ⚠️ Invisible  | We know who you are, but there is no acknowledgement. Impact can not be counted. |



## Troubleshooting

* "Access Denied" at ORCID: Ensure you are using the correct password for your ORCID account, not your university password.
* Looping Login: If the page redirects you repeatedly, try clearing your browser cookies or using an Incognito/Private window.
