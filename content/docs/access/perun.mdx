Your account and access to services are managed by [e-INFRA instance of Perun](https://perun.e-infra.cz), based on the AARC Blueprint Architecture. The Perun service will be useful when you need to:

- **check status** of your account (valid until, expired, blocked...),
- **view and manage groups** you are a member or administrator of
- **view resources and storages** you have acess to.

**Account properties, name, organization, identities, account extensions, or passwords** are conveniently managed through the [e-INFRA CZ User Profile](https://profile.e-infra.cz/). 

To get a complete user guide for Perun service, see [Perun documentation](https://perunaai.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PERUN/pages/524289/User+Documentation).
