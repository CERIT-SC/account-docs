- **Review and manage group memberships**, whether as a member or a group administrator.
- **Check available resources** and storage systems accessible with your account.

For **managing personal details**, such as your account identity, name, affiliated organization, linked identities, account renewal processes, or passwords, please use the [e-INFRA CZ User Profile](https://profile.e-infra.cz/).
