title: Managing Access Using Perun
---

Your account and associated service access are managed centrally by the [e-INFRA Perun](https://perun.e-infra.cz), based on the AARC Blueprint Architecture. 

Through Perun, you can:
- **Verify your account status** (e.g., active, expired).
- **Review and manage group memberships**, whether as a member or a group administrator.
- **Check available resources** and storage systems accessible with your account.

For **managing personal details**, such as your account identity, name, affiliated organization, linked identities, account renewal processes, or passwords, please use the [e-INFRA CZ User Profile](https://profile.e-infra.cz/). 

For detailed instructions and complete documentation on using Perun, refer to the official [Perun documentation](https://perunaai.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PERUN/pages/524289/User+Documentation).


<Callout type="info" title="Credentials">
By default, your e-INFRA CZ account does not require new credentials. However, some services may ask for a dedicated e-INFRA CZ username and password. You will be prompted to create these credentials the first time you access such a service.

Once created, the same credentials will be used across all services that require them. You can manage them anytime via the [e-INFRA CZ User Profile](https://profile.e-infra.cz).
